  <h1>What is the body mass index?</h1>

  <p class="bmi-p">The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual
    and the categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese based on that value.
    BMI is a screening tool that can indicate whether a person is underweight or if they have a healthy weight, excess
    weight, or obesity. If a person's BMI is outside of the healthy range, their health risks may increase
    significantly.
    The body mass index is universally expressed in kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters. The
    formula is stated as weight of the individual in kilograms divided by the height2 of the individual in meters.
    When using imperial units, the formula is: BMI = lbs x 703/in2<br><br>

  <h1>Categories of BMI values</h1>

  <p class="bmi-p">A BMI of less than 18.5 indicates that you are underweight, so you may need to put on some weight.
    You are recommended to ask your doctor or a dietitian for advice.

    A BMI of 18.5-24.9 indicates that you are at a healthy weight for your height. By maintaining a healthy weight, you
    lower your risk of developing serious health problems.

    A BMI of 25-29.9 indicates that you are slightly overweight. You may be advised to lose some weight for health
    reasons. You are recommended to talk to your doctor or a dietitian for advice.

    A BMI of over 30 indicates that you are heavily overweight. Your health may be at risk if you do not lose weight.
    You are recommended to talk to your doctor or a dietitian for advice.</p>

  <h1>How Accurate Is BMI?</h1>

  <p class="bmi-p">Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that has been used for over a century to determine whether a
    person is overweight or not.
    It is based on a simple formula invented in 1870 by a Belgian scientist, which divides a person‚Äôs weight by their
    height squared.
    In 2013, Nick Trefethen an Oxford University mathematician called out that this formula is flawed as the height
    value divides the weight by too much for short people,
    and too little for tall people. As he puts it ‚Äúso short people are misled into thinking they are thinner than they
    are, and tall people are misled into thinking they are fatter than
    they are.‚Äù He came up with a new formula for BMI (1.3 x weight/height2.5) which scales more accurately with height.
    However, Trefethen acknowledges that BMI is not a perfect measurement.
    The limitations of this tool are that it does not take into individual factors such as bone size, body frame, muscle
    fat or abdominal fat. It should therefore not be taken as a final evaluation of your health.
    BMI is misleading in the case of athletes, body builders, children and the elderly. Additionally men generally are
    more muscular than women, therefore the BMI for men and women of the same weight and height is not really exactly
    the same.
    However,to keep it simple the BMI values for both sexes are taken to be the same. Other tools that can be used in
    conjunction with the BMI Calculator India are the waist to hip ratio (WHR), ideal body weight calculation,
    and body fat percentage.

  <h1>The BMI values for children</h1>

  <p class="bmi-p">However, measuring BMI in children and teens is slightly different. Girls and boys develop at
    different rates and have different amounts of body fat at different ages. For this reason, BMI measurements during
    childhood and adolescence take age and sex into consideration.<br><br>
    It is calculated in the same way as for adults, but then compared to typical values for other children of the same
    age. Instead of comparison against fixed thresholds for underweight and overweight, the BMI is compared against the
    percentile for children of the same sex and age.<br><br>
    A BMI that is less than the 5th percentile is considered underweight and above the 95th percentile is considered
    obese. Children with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile are considered to be overweight. BMI is used
    differently for children. It is calculated in the same way as for adults, but then compared to typical values for
    other children of the same age. Instead of comparison against fixed thresholds for underweight and overweight, the
    BMI is compared against the percentile for children of the same sex and age.<br><br>
    A BMI that is less than the 5th percentile is considered underweight and above the 95th percentile is considered
    obese. Children with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile are considered to be overweight.<br><br>
    Doctors and other health professionals do not categorize children by healthy weight ranges because:
  <ul>
    <tab>
      <li>they change with each month of age</li>
      <li>male and female body types change at different rates</li>
      <li>they change as the child grows taller</li>
  </ul><br><br>
  Doctors calculate BMI for children and teens in the same way as they do for adults, by measuring height and weight.
  Then they locate the BMI number and person's age on a sex-specific BMI-for-age chart. This will indicate whether the
  child is within a healthy range.

  <h1>The Body Mass Index Chart & Obesity In India</h1>
  <p class="bmi-p">The international threshold for defining a person as overweight is a BMI of 25. So, if a person has a
    BMI greater than 25,
    he or she is considered overweight. However, the Indian Ministry of Health, has adjusted this value to 23 in
    accordance with WHO
    guidelines. Therefore for an Indian man or women, a BMI over 23 is classed as being overweight. An interesting fact
    is that Indians
    have a genetic tendency to abdominal obesity, therefore are at higher risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. It
    has also been
    observed that there are a greater number of Indian women who are obese compared to Indian men (in 2014 there were 20
    million obese
    women in India, and 9.8 million obese men).</p>
